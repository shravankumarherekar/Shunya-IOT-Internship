## **Challenge for Industries as of now:** Make the shift form Industry 3.0 to 4.0  

# **Industry 3.0**  
_In Industry 3.0, we automate processes using logic processors and information technology. These processes often operate largely without human interference, but there is still a human aspect behind it._ 

**Sensors(measures data)-> PLC(collects data)->SCADA and ERP(Store data)->stored in excels and csvs
_Problem identified:_ data do not get plotted as real time graphs or charts**

## **to**

# **Industry 4.0**  
_Where Industry 4.0 comes in is with the availability and use of vast quantities of data on the production floor._

**Connecting industry 3.0 to the internet to be able to analyze data reall-time(i/p data immediately processed to give relevant feedback
_Challenge:_ Re aligning industry 3.0 protocols to industry 4.0 protocols** 

> **Advantages:**  
* 1. Increased Quality as process happens based on the latest relevant information and is optimized  
* 2. Increase in overall effectiveness of process as it warrants a more flexible response to fluctuations in demand  
* 3. Better at identifying errors and wastage, thus lowering manufacturing costs  

> **Disadvantages:**  
* 1. Challenges with integrating data  
* 2. Concerns about data ownership and hence security  
* 3. increases immediate expenses(but saves cost in the long run)  
* 4. Downtime due to upgrading  

# **Differences:**

**Challenges in conversion:**  
> 1. Expensive Hardwire as licenses for such tools can cost a fortune  
> 2. Inadequate Documentation, hardware that are installed cannot be fully fathomed by engineers  
> 3. Trouble with PLC protocols that are proprietary  

## **Solution:**  
**Several libraries that act as Interfaces on embedded boards that have APIs doing the conversion from data from the PLC and sending it to cloud.  
IoT Gateways are hence much more economically friendly**

## **Appurtenances:**  
* 1. **Plenty of data collected and stored in Time series databases that convert it to beautiful diagrams where you can visualize the data with ease**

* 2. **IoT Platforms that analyse data such as Azure and AWS, they make heavy server systems and other related hardware obsolete**

* 3. **Alerts can be sent to our devices through GPS  with platforms like Twilio**
