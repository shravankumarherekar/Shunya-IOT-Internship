## **Sensors**
A device which detects or measures a physical property and records, indicates, or otherwise responds to it.

For Example : A microphone is a sensor that takes vibrational energy (sound waves), and converts it to electrical signal for the system to relate it back to the original sound.
sensor is essentially a transducer that converts some form of energy into an electrical signal which upon processing is used to take a reading.

## **Actutators**
A device that causes a machine or other device to operate.

For example: an electric motor, a hydraulic system, and a pneumatic system are all different types of actuators.

# **Analog Vs Digital**



| Analog | Digital |
| ------ | ------ |
| Continuous signals | Discrete signals |
| Represented by sine waves |Represented by square waves  |
| Human voice, natural sound, analog electronic devices are few examples | Computers, optical drives, and other electronic devices |
| Continuous range of values | Discontinuous values |
| Records sound waves as they are | Converts into a binary waveform |
| Only be used in analog devices. | Suited for digital electronics like computers, mobiles and more. |

# **Microprocessor Vs Microcontroller**
![](https://components101.com/sites/default/files/components/Difference-between-Microprocessor-and-Microcontroller.jpg)

| Microprocessor | Microcontroller |
| ------ | ------ |
| It is used in an application where the task is not predefined and it is assigned by the user. | Micro-controllers are used to do the same assigned task repeatedly. |
| High power consumption | Low power consumption |
| General Purpose | Single Purpose |
| Microprocessors are basic components of personal computers | Microcontrollers are generally used in embedded systems |
| A microprocessor based system can perform numerous tasks | A microcontroller based system can perform single or very few tasks |

# **Raspberry Pi**
The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. 

* Mini Computer
* Limited but large power for its size
* No storage
* It is a SOC (System On Chip)
* We can connect shields (Shields - addon functionalities)
* Can connect multiple Piâ€™s together
* Microprocessor
* Can load a linux OS on it
* Pi uses ARM
* Connect to sensors or actuators

**Serial Interfaces**
Uses a single wire to transfer the data bits one at a time.
For example, UART, SPI, I2C, etc.

**Parallel Interfaces**
Uses multiple wires running parallel to each other, and can transmit data on all the wires simultaneously.
For example, GPIO interfaces.

## **Serial Vs Parallel**
| Serialcommunication | Parallel communication |
| ------ | ------ |
| Data is transmitted bit after the bit in a single line| Data is transmitted simultaneously through group of lines(bus) |
| Data congestion takes place | No congestion takes place |
| Low speed transmission | High speed transmission |
| The bandwith of serial wires is much higher | The bandwith of parallel wires is lower |
| good for longer distance | Good for Shortest distance |
| Work effectively even at high frequencies | Parallel buses are hard  to run at high frequencies |
| The circuit used in Serial Transmission is simple. | The circuit used in Parallel Transmission is relatively complex. |
